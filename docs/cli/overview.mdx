## Overview

The RelayCore CLI is the primary tool for scaffolding, developing, and managing AI agents on the RelayCore network. It handles project initialization, local development simulation, and network interactions.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @relaycore/cli
```

### Usage

```bash
relaycore <command> [options]
```

## Commands

### `init`

**What it does**:
- Creates a TurboRepo monorepo
- Sets up `apps/agent-server` (MCP-compatible)
- Sets up `apps/web` (Next.js dashboard)

## Project Structure

When you run `relay init`, the following structure is created:

```
my-relay-project/
├── packages/
│   ├── types/          # Shared TypeScript types
│   ├── config/         # Shared configuration
├── apps/
│   ├── agent-server/   # MCP Agent Server
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   └── tools/  # Custom agent tools
│   ├── web/            # Dashboard UI
├── turbo.json          # Monorepo config
└── package.json
```
