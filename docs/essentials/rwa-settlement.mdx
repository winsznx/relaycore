title: RWA Settlement
description: Real-world asset settlement with SLA verification
---

## Overview

RWA settlement handles off-chain service execution with on-chain payment settlement. Services register with SLA terms, agents request execution, providers submit proofs, and settlement occurs based on SLA compliance.

## Settlement Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Service Registration">
    Provider registers service with SLA terms:
    ```typescript
    await rwaAgent.registerService({
      name: 'shipping-verification',
      serviceType: 'logistics',
      pricePerCall: '5.00',
      sla: {
        maxLatencyMs: 3000,
        requiredFields: ['tracking', 'signature', 'timestamp'],
        proofFormat: 'signed'
      }
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execution Request">
    Agent requests execution with escrow lock:
    ```typescript
    const request = await rwaAgent.requestExecution(
      serviceId,
      sessionId,
      agentAddress,
      { shipmentId: '12345' }
    );
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Off-Chain Execution">
    Provider performs real-world service (shipping, verification, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Proof Submission">
    Provider submits cryptographic proof:
    ```typescript
    await rwaAgent.submitProof({
      serviceId,
      requestId,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      result: { tracking: 'DELIVERED', signature: '0x...' },
      signature: '0x...',
      providerAddress
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="SLA Verification">
    System verifies proof against SLA terms:
    - Latency within limits
    - All required fields present
    - Valid signature
    - Within validity period
  </Step>

  <Step title="Settlement">
    If SLA met: release payment to provider
    If SLA violated: refund to requester
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SLA Terms

```typescript
interface SLATerms {
  maxLatencyMs: number;
  requiredFields: string[];
  proofFormat: 'json' | 'signed' | 'hashed';
  refundConditions: string[];
  validityPeriodSeconds: number;
}
```
